              <p>Use the Simple Present to express the idea that an action is repeated or usual. The action can be a habit, a hobby, a daily event, a scheduled event or something that often happens. It can also be something a person often forgets or usually does not do.</p>

              <p>The Simple Present can also indicate  the speaker believes that a fact was true before, is true now, and will be true in the future. It is not important if the speaker is correct about the fact. It is also used to make generalizations about people or things.</p>

              <p>In English, "now" can mean: this second, today, this month, this year, this century, and so on. Sometimes, we use the Present Continuous to say that we are in the process of doing a longer action which is in progress; however, we might not be doing it at this exact second.</p>

              <p>The Present Continuous with words such as "always" or "constantly" expresses the idea that something irritating or shocking often happens. Notice that the meaning is like  
                Simple Present, but with negative emotion. Remember to put the words "always" or "constantly" between "be" and "verb+ing."

              <p>The Simple Past can be used with a duration which starts and stops in the past. A duration is a longer action often indicated by expressions such as: for two years, for five minutes, all day, all year, etc.</p>

              <p>The Simple Past can also be used to describe a habit which stopped in the past. It can have the same meaning as "used to." To make it clear that we are talking about a habit, we often add expressions such as: always, often, usually, never, when I was a child, when I was younger, etc. </p>

            <div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;">
              <p>Clauses are groups of words which have meaning but are often not complete sentences. Some clauses begin with the word "when" such as "when I dropped my pen..." or "when class began..." These clauses are called when-clauses, and they are very important. The examples below contain when-clauses.</p>

                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul>

                  <li>She answered my question <strong>when I paid her one dollar</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>When-clauses are important because they always happen first when both clauses are in the Simple Past. Both of the examples above mean the same thing: first, I paid her one dollar, and then, she answered my question. It is not important whether "when I paid her one dollar" is at the beginning of the sentence or at the end of the sentence. However, the example below has a different meaning. First, she answered my question, and then, I paid her one dollar.</p>
              <div class="ex">

              <p>In English, we often use a series of parallel actions to describe the atmosphere at a particular time in the past.</p>
              <div class="ex">
                <p>Example:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>When I walked into the office, several people <strong>were</strong> busily <strong>typing</strong>, some <strong>were talking</strong> on the phones, the boss <strong>was yelling</strong> directions, and customers <strong>were waiting</strong> to be helped. One customer <strong>was yelling</strong> at a secretary and <strong>waving</strong> his hands. Others <strong>were complaining</strong> to each other about the bad service.</li>

            <div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;">
              <p>The Past Continuous with words such as "always" or "constantly" expresses the idea that something irritating or shocking often happened in the past. The concept is very similar to the expression "used to" but with negative emotion. Remember to put the words "always" or "constantly" between "be" and "verb+ing."</p>
              <div class="ex">
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>She <strong>was always coming</strong> to class late.</li>
                  <li>He <strong>was constantly talking</strong>. He annoyed everyone.</li>
                  <li>I didn't like them because they <strong>were always complaining</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <b>While vs. When </b>
              <p>Clauses are groups of words which have meaning, but are often not complete sentences. Some clauses begin with the word "when" such as "when she called" or "when it bit me." Other clauses begin with "while" such as "while she was sleeping" and "while he was surfing." When you talk about things in the past, "when" is most often followed by the verb tense Simple Past, whereas "while" is usually followed by Past Continuous. "While" expresses the idea of "during that time." Study the examples below. They have  similar meanings, but they emphasize different parts of the sentence.</p>
              <div class="ex">
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul>

            <div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;">
              <p>We use the Present Perfect to say that an action happened at an unspecified time before now. The exact time is not important. You CANNOT use the Present Perfect with specific time expressions such as: yesterday, one year ago, last week, when I was a child, when I lived in Japan, at that moment, that day, one day, etc. We CAN use the Present Perfect with unspecific expressions such as: ever, never, once, many times, several times, before, so far, already, yet, etc. </p>
              <div class="ex">
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I <strong>have seen</strong> that movie twenty times.</li>

                  <li>There <strong>have been</strong> many earthquakes in California.</li>
                  <li>People <strong>have traveled</strong> to the Moon.</li>
                  <li>People <strong>have not traveled</strong> to Mars. </li>
                  <li><strong>Have</strong> you <strong>read</strong> the book yet? </li>
                  <li>Nobody <strong>has</strong> ever <strong>climbed</strong> that mountain. </li>
                  <li>A: <strong>Has</strong> there ever <strong>been</strong> a war in the United States?<br>
                    B: Yes, there <strong>has been</strong> a war in the United States.

              <b>How Do You Actually Use the Present Perfect?</b>
              <p>The concept of "unspecified time" can be very confusing to English learners. It is best to associate Present Perfect with the following topics:</p>
              <b>TOPIC 1 Experience</b>
              <p>You can use the Present Perfect to describe your experience. It is like saying, "I have the experience of..." You can also use this tense to say that you have never had a certain experience. The Present Perfect is NOT used to describe a specific event.</p>
              <div class="ex">
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I <strong>have been</strong> to France.<br>
                    <em class="comment">This sentence means that you have had the experience of being in France. Maybe you have been there once, or several times.</em>
                  </li>
                  <li>I <strong>have been</strong> to France three times.<br>
                    <em class="comment">You can add the number of times at the end of the sentence.</em>
                  </li>
                  <li>I <strong>have</strong> never <strong>been</strong> to France.<br>
                    <em class="comment">This sentence means that you have not had the experience of going to France.</em>
                  </li>
                  <li>I think I <strong>have seen</strong> that movie before.</li>
                  <li>He <strong>has</strong> never <strong>traveled</strong> by train.</li>
                  <li>Joan <strong>has studied</strong> two foreign languages.</li>
                  <li>A: <strong>Have</strong> you ever <strong>met</strong> him?<br>
                    B: No, I <strong>have</strong> not <strong>met</strong> him.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <b>TOPIC 2 Change Over Time</b>
              <p>We often use the Present Perfect to talk about change that has happened over a period of time.</p>
              <div class="ex">
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>You <strong>have grown</strong> since the last time I saw you.</li>
                  <li>The government <strong>has become</strong> more interested in arts education.</li>
                  <li>Japanese <strong>has become</strong> one of the most popular courses at the university since the Asian studies program was established.</li>
                  <li>My English <strong>has</strong> really <strong>improved</strong> since I moved to Australia.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <b>TOPIC 3 Accomplishments</b>
              <p>We often use the Present Perfect to list the accomplishments of individuals and humanity. You cannot mention a specific time.</p>
              <div class="ex">
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Man <strong>has walked</strong> on the Moon.</li>
                  <li>Our son <strong>has learned</strong> how to read.</li>
                  <li>Doctors <strong>have cured</strong> many deadly diseases.</li>
                  <li>Scientists <strong>have split</strong> the atom.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <b>TOPIC 4 An Uncompleted Action You Are Expecting</b>
              <p>We often use the Present Perfect to say that an action which we expected has not happened. Using the Present Perfect suggests that we are still waiting for the action to happen. </p>
              <div class="ex">
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>James <strong>has not finished</strong> his homework yet.</li>
                  <li>Susan <strong>hasn't mastered</strong> Japanese, but she can communicate.</li>
                  <li>Bill <strong>has</strong> still <strong>not arrived</strong>.</li>
                  <li>The rain <strong>hasn't stopped</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <b>TOPIC 5 Multiple Actions at Different Times</b>
              <p>We also use the Present Perfect to talk about several different actions which have occurred in the past at different times. Present Perfect suggests the process is not complete and more actions are possible.</p>
              <div class="ex">
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The army <strong>has attacked</strong> that city five times.</li>
                  <li>I <strong>have had</strong> four quizzes and five tests so far this semester.</li>
                  <li>We <strong>have had</strong> many major problems while working on this project.</li>
                  <li>She <strong>has talked</strong> to several specialists about her problem, but nobody knows why she is sick.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <b>Time Expressions with Present Perfect</b>
              <p> When we use the Present Perfect it means that something has happened at some point in our lives before now. Remember, the exact time the action happened is not important. </p>
              <p><img src="../img/tense_list/presentperfect.gif" alt="" height="50" width="258"></p>
              <p>Sometimes, we want to limit the time we are looking in for an experience. We can do this with expressions such as: in the last week, in the last year, this week, this month, so far, up to now, etc.</p>
              <p><img src="../img/tense_list/presentperfectlimit.gif" alt="" height="50" width="258"></p>
              <div class="ex">
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Have</strong> you <strong>been</strong> to Mexico <strong>in the last year</strong>?</li>
                  <li>I <strong>have seen</strong> that movie six times <strong>in the last month</strong>.</li>
                  <li>They <strong>have had</strong> three tests <strong>in the last week</strong>.</li>
                  <li>She graduated from university less than three years ago. She <strong>has worked</strong> for three different companies <strong>so far</strong>.</li>

              <p>"Last year" and "in the last year" are very different in meaning. "Last year" means the year before now, and it is considered a specific time which requires Simple Past.

                <p>You can also use the Present Perfect Continuous WITHOUT a duration such as "for two weeks." Without the duration, the tense has a more general meaning of "lately." We often use the words "lately" or "recently"  to emphasize this meaning.</p>

                <p>Remember that the Present Perfect Continuous has the meaning of "lately" or "recently." If you use the Present Perfect Continuous in a question such as "Have you been feeling alright?", it can suggest that the person looks sick or unhealthy. A question such as "Have you been smoking?" can suggest that you  smell the smoke on the person. Using this tense in a question suggests you can see, smell, hear or feel the results of the action. It is possible to insult someone by using this tense incorrectly.</p>

                  <p>With Non-Continuous Verbs and some non-continuous uses of Mixed Verbs, we use the Past Perfect to show that something started in the past and continued up until another action in the past.</p>
                  <div class="ex">
                    <p>Examples:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>We <strong>had had</strong> that car for ten years before it broke down.</li>
                      <li>By the time Alex finished his studies, he <strong>had been</strong> in London for over eight years.</li>
                      <li>They felt bad about selling the house because they <strong>had owned</strong> it for more than forty years.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                  Although the above use of Past Perfect is normally limited to Non-Continuous Verbs and non-continuous uses of Mixed Verbs, the words "live," "work," "teach," and "study" are sometimes used in this way even though they are NOT Non-Continuous Verbs.

                  <p>Unlike with the Present Perfect, it is possible to use specific time words or phrases with the Past Perfect. Although this is possible, it is usually not necessary.</p>
                  <div class="ex">
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>She <strong>had visited</strong> her Japanese relatives once in 1993 before she moved in with them in 1996.</li>

                <div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;">
                  <p>If the Past Perfect action did occur at a specific time, the Simple Past can be used instead of the Past Perfect when "before" or "after" is used in the sentence. The words "before" and "after" actually tell you what happens first, so the Past Perfect is optional. For this reason, both sentences below are correct.</p>
                  <div class="ex">
                    <p>Examples:</p>

              <p> If you do not include a duration such as "for five minutes," "for two weeks" or "since Friday," many English speakers choose to use the Past Continuous rather than the Past Perfect Continuous.

          <p>Simple Future has two different forms in English: "will" and "be going to." Although the two forms can sometimes be used interchangeably, they often express two very different meanings.

            <div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;">
              <p>"Will" often suggests that a speaker will do something voluntarily. A voluntary action is one the speaker offers to do for someone else. Often, we use "will" to respond to someone else's complaint or request for help. We also use "will" when we request that someone help us or volunteer to do something for us. Similarly, we use "will not" or "won't" when we refuse to voluntarily do something. </p>

              <div class="ex">

              <p>Notice in the examples above that the interruptions (<em class="italics">marked in italics</em>) are  in Simple Present rather than Simple Future. This is because the interruptions are  in time clauses, and you cannot use future tenses in time clauses.</p>

              <p>The Future Perfect expresses the idea that something will occur before another action in the future. It can also show that something will happen before a specific time in the future.</p>

              <p>Although the above use of Future Perfect is normally limited to Non-Continuous Verbs and non-continuous uses of Mixed Verbs, the words "live," "work," "teach," and "study" are sometimes used in this way even though they are NOT Non-Continuous Verbs.</p>

            <p>Like "used to" and Simple Past, "would always" expresses the idea that something was an old habit which stopped in the past. It says that an action was often repeated in the past, but it is not usually done now. Unlike "used to" and Simple Past, "would always" suggests that someone willingly acted that way and sometimes expresses annoyance or amusement at the habit. It also often suggests the habit was extreme. To express the opposite idea, we can  say "would never" to indicate that someone never did something in the past, but now they do. </p>

                <p>"Would always" is not exactly the same as "used to" or the Simple Past. "Would always" cannot be used to talk about past facts or generalizations. It can only be used for repeated actions.</p>

                <p>In addition to "would always," English speakers often use "would constantly," "would often,"  "would forever" or simply "would." Although the last form "would" is correct, it is not suggested because it can easily be confused with other verb forms such as the Conditional or Future in the Past. Similarly, speakers can use "would rarely," "would occasionally" and  "would seldom" to express the idea that an action was not often repeated. </p>

          <p>Like Simple Future, Future in the Past has two different forms in English: "would" and "was going to." Although the two forms can sometimes be used interchangeably, they often express two  different meanings.</p>

            <div class="spoiler-body" style="display: none;">
              <p>Future in the Past is used to express the idea that in the past you thought something would happen in the future. It does not matter if you are correct or not. Future in the Past follows the same basic rules as the Simple Future. "Would" is used to volunteer or promise, and "was going to" is used to plan. Moreover, both forms can be used to make predictions about the future.</p>
